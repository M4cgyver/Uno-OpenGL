# Uno-OpenGL
This was my final for my first semister/year programming. Java was the launguage that we had to show so I decieded to practice with OpenGL. Still dont quite understand the shader concept but it works greate so far!

I also added multiplayer via internet, granted you need to be on lan or use ngrok or something to get it working but all in all its aok.
